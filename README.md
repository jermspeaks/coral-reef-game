A Science Hack Day SF 2015 hack.

## Introduction

Coral reefs are regarded as rainforests of the sea.
They are a delicate ecosystem that must be preserved as they bring wonder and excitement.
They are also habitat to species that make up our interconnected food chain.

This board game is to help kids understand what impacts coral reefs and they can do about it.
